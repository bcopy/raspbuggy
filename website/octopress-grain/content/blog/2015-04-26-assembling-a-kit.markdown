Today, as a birthday gift, I took a car chassis kit, a wifi dongle, a raspberry pi B model and a
pibrella to my 10 year old godson and we set out to putting it all together.

I was quite surprised at how quick he was able to put it all together and how well he understood the general principle.
In about an hour, we had assembled the kit, configured all the elements and managed to write a simple program that 
would send the car in a straight line when the Pibrella's push button was triggered.
