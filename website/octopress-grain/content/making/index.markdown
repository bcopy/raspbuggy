# How to make your own Raspbuggy

Instructions to make your own Raspbuggy at this stage are not finalized.
The bill of materials required is still under work, the software still under
development.

You can follow the evolution of the project by subscribing to our blog and our
[Github repository](http://github.com/CMCRobotics/raspbuggy).
